            The Horses are large, strong mammals known for their speed, beauty, and long-standing partnership with humans.
            They have been domesticated for thousands of years and have played crucial roles in transportation, agriculture, and sports.
            Horses are herbivores and typically have a strong social structure within their herds. They come in various breeds, 
            each with unique characteristics suited for different purposes, such as racing, riding, or work. Horses have a powerful sense of hearing and eyesight,
            and they communicate through body language and vocalizations. They are revered for their intelligence, loyalty, and companionship with humans.
