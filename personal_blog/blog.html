            <h2>My cute sloth!!</h2>
            <p>
            Sloths are cute, slow-moving mammals found in Central and South America. 
            They spend most of their time in trees, eating leaves and sleeping up to 20 hours a day. With their unique appearance and relaxed demeanor,
            sloths have become popular symbols of chill and tranquility in popular culture. I love sloth!

            <h2>My cute and strong horse!!</h2>
            <p>
            The Horses are large, strong mammals known for their speed, beauty, and long-standing partnership with humans.
            They have been domesticated for thousands of years and have played crucial roles in transportation, agriculture, and sports.
            Horses are herbivores and typically have a strong social structure within their herds. They come in various breeds, 
            each with unique characteristics suited for different purposes, such as racing, riding, or work. Horses have a powerful sense of hearing and eyesight,
            and they communicate through body language and vocalizations. They are revered for their intelligence, loyalty, and companionship with humans.
